In 2010 we were asked to revamp and relaunch the magazine for the China-Britain Business Council and the British Chamber of Commerce. A new name, a new look and six years later, the monthly FOCUS magazine is read by the highest level of business and government leaders across China and the UK.

The magazine includes contributions from diplomats, business leaders, academics and experts to create a must-read publication for those interested in China-UK business relations.

As well as creator of the monthly magazine, we are the preferred supplier on all supplements, reports and further publications for the CBBC and its members.
