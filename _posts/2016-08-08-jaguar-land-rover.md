We helped conceptualise and deliver stories for the Jaguar Innovation Tour in China that included finding talent, location sourcing, production of events and media involvement. The two legs in China included a race between a James Bond stuntman and the world drone racing champion, and an experience along China's Sky Road with the road's engineer.

Content was also produced for the Dubai leg of the tour which saw Jetman racing Formula 1 Driver Martin Brundell. Significant coverage was gained in major media including Sky TV, Discovery Channel and the Daily Telegraph.
